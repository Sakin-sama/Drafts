<p>  "Unnie, I miss you," Minjeong whispered to the gravestone, knowing she wouldn't receive a response. It'd been exactly 1 year, to the day, since Jimin stopped responding to her. Since she embraced Jimin's body and there was no longer the comfortable warmth she had grown used to, only the uninviting coldness of death.</p>

<p> Minjeong stood up from where she was knelt in front of Jimin’s grave, beginning to feel the cold of night seeping into her bones. It was past midnight, but Minjeong thought this time was best to talk with Jimin again. She let out a breath, and pulled her jacket tighter to her body. Jimin’s jacket. The one she always used to give to Minjeong when they were on dates. Minjeong would grumble about it, but she secretly loved it. It made her feel safe, protected, <i>loved</i>.</p>

<p> That’s what made Jimin’s death hurt her all the more. She was perfect. Jimin was perfect. They were perfect together. So <i>why?</i> Why, <i>why</i> did it all have to go wrong?</p>

<p align="center">————————————</p>

<p> It was all Jimin’s fault. Jimin’s fault for seeing, for learning her secret. Because Minjeong always made sure to hide it well. She never kept her knives out. Always washed the blood off before coming home to her Jiminie. She made sure to finish before Jimin came home from work, or while she was asleep, or on a business trip. Anything to make sure she didn’t see this side of Minjeong. No, she didn’t need to see Minjeong’s secret, she only needed to see the sweet and innocent Minjeong, the Minjeong she loved. And Minjeong would do anything, <i>anything</i> to make sure Jimin always loved her.</p>

<p align="center">————————————</p>

<p> It was cold that day, and Minjeong hated the cold. She preferred the warm embrace of her Unnie. That day, Minjeong was in a mood—someone bumped into her and spilled her coffee in the morning, and didn’t even apologize! It was their fault she was late to work, their fault she was yelled at. Although, it was her choice to follow the man out of the coffee shop, adding thirty minutes to her normally short coffee run. But in her eyes, he made it necessary. So it was his fault.</p>

<p> The added time paid off though. As soon as she got off work, she checked the tracker she subtly placed in the man’s bag earlier. Now was the perfect time to blow off steam—her Jimin-unnie wouldn’t return from Japan for three more days—so she had plenty of time to use their apartment and clean up afterwards. It was a compromise she made with herself after moving in with Jimin—doing the job on the fly. She was used to spending her time on every victim, drawing out her fun until she was satisfied with her art. But she managed with only taking her time every so often (mostly when Jimin was out of town), so that her Unnie never found out. Because no one, not even her beloved, could know of her secret.</p>

<p> So she tracked the man, and watched. She watched him for three hours before approaching, waiting outside of his house until he eventually left. She followed him to the club, a plan forming in her pretty little head. She must’ve been blessed that night, since the club was the perfect opportunity to take a man home.</p>

<p> It was rather easy, with how dumb he was. All Minjeong had to do was batter her eyelashes, speak in that saccharine voice her Unnie loves, and ask if the man wanted to find somewhere quieter. How easily he fell for it! Minjeong was not afraid to weaponize her charms, the charms that brought her and Jimin together.</p>

<p> He let himself be led into Minjeong’s apartment, not realizing an inkling of what would be to come, until he felt something sharp against his ribs.</p>

<p> “Now, don’t move and listen like a good boy, and I’ll be nice, yes?” Minjeong’s demeanor did a 180, going from cute and clingy to something that made his back shiver in fear. The glint in her eyes, the way she held the knife, there was no anger,  hate, greed; none of the emotions that one would expect from the person threatening you at knifepoint. No. Minjeong’s eyes only held glee, a crazed look on her face, the knife steady in a way that spoke of familiarity with this situation.</p>

<p> He could tell 2 things instantly, just by looking at her. The first was that she was completely, utterly mad. And the second that he would likely not leave this apartment alive. It didn’t matter that he was larger than her, could physically overpower her. His masculinity destroyed in an instant under the gaze of someone truly psychotic, one who held no conventional fears, one who would stop at <b>nothing</b> to get what she wanted.</p>

<p> She stepped away from him to grab the folding table that she kept specifically for this purpose. He didn’t move a muscle when she stepped away, still petrified in fear. She led him to the table, set up in the middle of the living room; straight ahead from the doorway. Jimin and Minjeong were fortunate to own quite a spacious apartment, one with enough room to accommodate Minjeong’s little hobby without her love noticing.</p>

<p> She tied him to the table, arms and legs unmoving under the leather straps. She bent down, mouth to his ear, and whispered, “It’s better if you don’t move as much. It’s hard to make straight lines when people struggle.” She uttered her words in a matter-of-fact tone, for she had no thoughts of how demented they sounded, only that she didn’t want her fun to be dampened by an unruly subject.</p>

<p> The man gave no response. He hadn’t spoken since entering the apartment, still under the effects of shock. The only sign that he was not catatonic was his eyes, the eyes that never strayed from the knife in Minjeong’s hand, the knife that hadn’t left her hand since she took it out.</p>

<p> “I do hope you act less meek when I get started. I’d hate to have a boring audience, wouldn’t you agree?” He barely registered the words coming from his captivator’s mouth, only giving a slight nod in response, feeling beads of sweat drop down his forehead. She tutted at him, giving a disapproving look at his lack of enthusiasm, and turned away.</p>

<p> Minjeong disappeared once more, and returned with a medium-sized black bag that seemed rather heavy from the way she was struggling slightly to carry it. She plopped the bag down on the sofa, and unzipped it. He watched as she rummaged through it, humming a tune to herself. After a minute or two, she pulled out a scalpel and a pair of medical scissors.</p>

<p> “These should do for now! They’ll leave such a pretty pattern against your skin, don’t you think?” Minjeong was more vibrant than before, seemingly excited at the prospect of what she was about to do. It was now that the man started shaking, jerking against his restraints.</p>

<p> He was about to cry out, but her hand quickly shut over his mouth, and he stopped his movements, merely trembling now, with the occasional whimper coming out of his mouth. “This is better than before, you’re awake, yes? But… don’t scream yet. I don’t want you to waste your voice,” Minjeong exclaimed, joyous, yet he could feel the slight disappointment underlying her tone. Something told him to be wary of that disappointment. “And do try to keep it down? These walls may be thick, but they aren’t soundproof ya know.”</p>

<p> She then used the scissors to cut through his clothes, exposing his chest and abdomen. He began to silently cry, his eyes glazed over in fear. Minjeong took the scalpel to his sternum, and began drawing a line down his chest…</p>

<p> Jimin was excited, for lack of a better word. The conference she went to had ended early, and she would be able to get home almost three whole days earlier than expected. Wanted to surprise her girlfriend, she decided not to tell her. She thought of the shocked expression she’d see on the younger girl’s face, seeing her Unnie home early. <i>Minjeongie’s face will be so cute!!!</i> She imagined what would happen, seeing her love wake up in the morning and realize her Jiminie was right there! After all, her favorite side of Minjeong was how cute she got when surprised or excited, especially when she was all soft and cuddly in the morning.. Not to say that Jimin didn’t love all sides of her Minjeongie, of course she did.</p>

<p> When Jimin arrived back in Korea, the first thing she did was take a cab home. It was past midnight, but Jimin thought this time was best, since Minjeong would be deep asleep and she’d have enough time to get some rest as well. She took the deserted elevator up to their apartment, lugging her suitcase behind her. She walked up to the door, fumbling in her purse for her keys. She unlocked and opened the door as quietly as possible, swinging it wide open to reveal their dark apartment, still in the night—</p>

<p> <i>No. Wait. What’s… that? </i>She opened the door, and their apartment’s lights were still on, and there was a person in the living room. <i>Her Minjeongie.</i> Who was standing next to a table, deep in concentration. And on the table—Jimin dropped her purse with a <i>bang</i> on the floor, startling her girlfriend.</p>

<p>“J– Jiminie? Wha– Why– you shouldn’t be here yet,” Minjeong looked away from the table, the contents of which Jimin couldn’t, wouldn’t, process yet. “Unnie, why’d you have to come home so early?” Minjeong looked crestfallen, speaking in a broken whisper. She dropped the bloody scalpel to the floor with a <i>clank</i>. “You– here– no. no. no. no. <i>why?</i> I–.”</p>

<p> Jimin finally broke out of her stupor, and properly looked at what was on the table. The sight of what was once a man, now bloody and broken, made her throw up. The stench of blood, the splatter on her girlfriend’s clothes and cheeks, it was too much for her. Minjeong began to walk over to her, and she backed up, subconsciously moving out of fear.</p>

<p> Minjeong, scared of the thought of Jimin escaping, grabbed her knife and ran over to her. She held her knife, the same one she threatened him with, and held to her beloved’s ribs. “Jimin-unnie,” she said in that saccharine whisper, almost a growl, now tinted with sorrow, “You can’t leave. Not now.”</p>

<p align="center">————————————</p>

<p> Jimin woke up tied to a chair, one of the ones that used to sit in front of the dining table. Her head throbbed, and she guessed Minjeong knocked her out and tied her up. There was duct tape over her mouth, to match the bindings around her ankles and calves. She looked around, and saw the remnants of him still sitting on the table next to her. She tried to scream through her gag, jerking at her restraints.</p>

<p> Minjeong caressed her cheek, “Shh, my love. You’ll hurt your throat, and bruise your wrists. You just had such a long flight, doesn’t my baby want to rest?” Her soft words and warm touches contrasting the blood on her hands, but Jimin could still see it, could still see that loving gaze in her eyes. And that only made her struggle more, knowing that Minjeong’s love for her wouldn’t help her at all, knowing that this was not the Minjeong she knew, no, this was a stranger. In her eyes, the Kim Minjeong she fell in love with five years ago disappeared the moment she saw that table, that man</p>

<p> And that was when she began to cry, began to mourn. To mourn her Minjeongie, the innocent and pure girl, not <i>this</i>; not a psychotic, deranged killer. This was not her Minjeongie. She couldn’t even entertain the thought that the Minjeong who acted sweet and pure, cuddling her in bed, was the same girl holding a knife to her body, tying her up in their living room.</p>

<p> “I’m sorry Unnie, but I can’t let you go anymore. Don’t you see? You won’t love me anymore now that you know about this part of me.” Jiminie couldn’t bring herself to meet Minjeong’s eyes, the sad ones that were still undeniably full of love, when she herself could no longer return that feeling. “Unnie, I don’t want you to not love me anymore. I’ll make sure that you always love me, okay? I’ll make sure to keep this a secret, so that you only remember the me that you love, ok? After all, two can keep a secret,” her voice went low on those final words, smiling sadly at her love, her everything, “If one of us is dead.”</p>
