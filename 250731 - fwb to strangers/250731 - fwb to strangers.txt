Basically jmj were fwb's then one day mj releases this poem and JM sees and then it's kinda open ended but implies mutual pining and "what could've been vibes"
angst, open ending, fwb to strangers

1) start with the poem, go retrospective from Jimin's perspective with flashbacks?
2) Go in chronological order
