Basically jmj were fwb's then one day mj releases a poem about jm and jm sees and then it's kinda open ended but implies mutual pining and "what could've been vibes"
angst, open ending, fwb to strangers

Title: smth about how all that's left is the poem... idk


1) start with the poem, go retrospective from Jimin's perspective with flashbacks?
2) Go in chronological order
