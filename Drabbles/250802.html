<p>Jimin opened her eyes, taking in the view in front of her. The vacation was Ningning's idea ("You two need to have some fun together!"). Her friend was right tough, Jimin couldn't even remember the last time she and Minjeong had taken a proper vacation since their honeymoon four years ago.</p>

<p>That wasn't the plan when they got married, but with work and Minjeong's unexpected pregnancy and whatnot, any vacation plans they made quickly fell through--they simply didn't have the time. This time, however, the stars aligned for them. They both were able to take a full week off work (at the same time!), and the twins were finally at an age where Jimin felt safe leaving them with Ning and Aeri. While she loved her friends dearly, Jimin had misgivings when it came to their abilities to take care of a living, breathing human being--<i>especially</i> her own.</p>
