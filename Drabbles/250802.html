<p>Jimin opened her eyes, taking in the view in front of her. The vacation was Ningning's idea ("You two need to have some fun together!"). Her friend was right tough, Jimin couldn't even remember the last time she and Minjeong had taken a proper vacation since their honeymoon four years ago.</p>

<p>That wasn't the plan when they got married, but with work and Minjeong's unexpected pregnancy and whatnot, any vacation plans they made quickly fell through--they simply didn't have the time. This time, however, the stars aligned for them. They both were able to take a full week off work (at the same time!), and the twins were finally at an age where Jimin felt safe leaving them with Ning and Aeri. While she loved her friends dearly, Jimin had misgivings when it came to their abilities to take care of a living, breathing human being--<i>especially</i> her own.</p>

<p>So thanks to Ning's stubborn insistence, she and Minjeong were staying in an Airbnb for the next three days, situated on the side of a mountain in the Japanese countryside. <i>We deserve it for how hard we've worked our asses off,</i> Jimin resolved (Or at least, she had to have <i>some</i> explanation for why their checking account was now noticeably lighter than before).</p>

<p>"Baby! Where are you?" Minjeong's yell pulled the brunette out of her mind, and back to Earth. She stood from the lounge chair, stretching her back and shoulders. <i>God I'm getting old,</i> she lamented. Sure, she was sore often back when they were young and idols, but feeling stiff just from sitting down was unacceptable! Jimin blamed it on the kids.</p>

<p>"I was on the porch Jeongie! I'll be right there," she replied, closing the sliding glass door behind her as she stepped inside and walked towards the bedroom.</p>

<p>"I missed you. You weren't there when I woke up"</p>

<p>Jimin chuckled, climbed onto the bed and attempted to give the younger a hug through all the blankets she was swaddled in. <i>My wife is too cute... My wife...</i> She liked the way it sounded in her head, knowing that Minjeong was <i>hers.</i> "My wife," she declared to the air triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Yes baby?"</p>

<p>"My wife."</p>

<p>"That I am... is there something on your mind, love?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. I just like calling you my wife." The reasoning was solid in Jimin's mind, as she snuggled closer in Minjeong's embrace.</p>

<p>"Babe? As much as I love it when you're clingy, we do have to get up eventually."</p>

<p>Jimin grumbled into the blonde's neck, "Just five more minutes."</p>

<p>"Babe! You were literally up and awake earlier!" Giggling, she (reluctantly) forced her wife off of her, heading to the bathroom to start her morning routine.</p>
