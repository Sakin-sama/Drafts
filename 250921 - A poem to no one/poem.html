<p>I receive this glimps through you,<br>
This glimpse into what you have,<br>
That which I never wil,<br>
Or at least never did;<br>
This glimpse to you, from you, of you.<br>
<br>
A love unlike any other,<br>
So bright that looking directly will burn thine eyes,<br>
Like the glorious Sun at midday rise.<br>
Through the gap in curtains I peek,<br>
At the love you have, that which I see,<br>
Somedays near, some far,<br>
Far, far away, high up<br>
On the pedastal I placed.<br>
<br>
Those days, I realize it for what it is,<br>
Worship isn't love, it's<br>
Distance.<br>
Dressed as devotion.<br>
<br>
Society calls them lovers:<br>
"A pair of individuals who love each other." (1)<br>
But they forget about lovers:<br>
"Those who love love, even if they don't feel it themselves." (1)<br>
<br>
They say love is for he and she, but<br>
Not for what lie inbetween.<br>
What about them?<br>
What about for you and for you whom love so desperately?<br>
Away:<br>
From prying eyes,<br>
From public opinion,<br>
From religous law,<br>
From political law.<br>
Lovers? No. Lover's.<br>
<br>
Your gift to me,<br>
From lovers to lover's,<br>
A gift not given but well received,<br>
Like lenses that make the blurry clear,<br>
To see the world through a different lens,<br>
The world-lens not of one half of a pair of lovers,<br>
But of one piece of many lover's.<br>
<br>
That in which I may not partake but only glimpse,<br>
May only see, never<br>
Touch, never<br>
Experience.<br>
You, you two, are<br>
Michealangelo's David; behind banister and queue,<br>
And I, the child reaching forwards, afar,<br>
With twinkling eyes,<br>
Awoken as if he'd eaten<br>
The very Fruit of Eden.<br>
<br>
You are every painting, every sculpture, every bust
In the Louvre,
The Met,
The
