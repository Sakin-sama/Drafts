<p>I receive this glimps through you,<br>
This glimpse into what you have,<br>
That which I never wil,<br>
Or at least never did;<br>
This glimpse to you, from you, of you.<br>
<br>
A love unlike any other,<br>
So bright that looking directly will burn thine eyes,<br>
Like the glorious Sun at midday rise.<br>
Through the gap in curtains I peek,<br>
At the love you have, that which I see,<br>
