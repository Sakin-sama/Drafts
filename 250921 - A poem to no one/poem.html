<p>I receive this glimpse through you,<br>
This glimpse into what you have,<br>
That which I never will,<br>
Or at least never did;<br>
This glimpse to you, from you, of you.<br>
<br>
A love unlike any other,<br>
So bright that looking directly will burn thine eyes,<br>
Like the glorious Sun at midday rise.<br>
Through the gap in curtains I peek,<br>
At the love you have, that which all seek,<br>
Somedays near, some far,<br>
Far, far away, high up<br>
On the pedestal I placed.<br>
<br>
On those days, I realize it for what it is,<br>
Worship isn't love, it's<br>
Distance.<br>
Dressed as devotion.<br>
<br>
Society calls them lovers:<br>
A pair of individuals who love each other.<br>
But they forget about lovers:<br>
Those who love love,<br>
Even if they don't feel it themselves.<br>
Lovers? No. Lover's.<br>
<br>
They say love is for he and she, but<br>
What about all who lie in-between.<br>
What about them?<br>
What about you and you whom love so desperately?<br>
Away,<br>
From prying eyes,<br>
From public opinion,<br>
From religous doctrine,<br>
From political law.<br>
<br>
Your gift to me,<br>
From lovers to lover's,<br>
A gift not given but well received,<br>
Like lenses that make the blurry clear,<br>
To see the world through a different lens,<br>
The world-lens not of one half of a pair of lovers,<br>
But of one piece of many lover's.<br>
<br>
That in which I may not partake but only view,<br>
May only see, never<br>
Touch, never<br>
Experience.<br>
You, you two, are<br>
Michelangelo's David; behind banister and line,<br>
And I, the child reaching forwards, afar,<br>
With a twinkle in the eye,<br>
Awoken as if he'd eaten<br>
The very Fruit of Eden.<br>
<br>
You are every painting, every sculpture, every bust<br>
In the Louvre, in the Met,<br>
But you are so, so much more,<br>
For an art gallery could never be as unique as you.<br>
