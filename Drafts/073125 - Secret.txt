Idk yet, but smth about the lyrics...
Like Jimin found something that Minjeong wanted to hide, like her serial killer tendencies maybe, so she goes psycho, ties up Jimin and kills her, but she still loves her and it's like "I love you but you found my secret and two can keep a secret if one of us is dead"
